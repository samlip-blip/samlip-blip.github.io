title: Bernstein-Vazirani-Problem-Exploration
---

In this notebook we explore the Bernstein-Vazirani problem and respective quantum algorithm. 
We will show that the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm owes its existence to one mathematical identity which has nothing to do with quantum mechanics
and thanks to the quantum entanglement, which is effected by Hadammard gates is able to find a secret number in 1 trial.
