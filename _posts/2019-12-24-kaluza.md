title: ON THE UNIFICATION PROBLEM IN PHYSICS - THE PAPER OF THEODOR KALUZA
---

 

 

The aim of this book is to present the paper of Theodor Kaluza On the
Unification Problem in Physics in about 100 pages. Kaluza left the basic
principles of general relativity theory untouched and only added an extra
dimension. Amazingly, with this incredible addition, Kaluza has discovered that
it can reproduce both Einstein's equations of gravity and Maxwell's equations of
electromagnetism with one set of relations. The book provides complete
derivations of all equations.
